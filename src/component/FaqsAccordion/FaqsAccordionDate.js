							showAnswer:true

					{
							question:"Will you run my credit score?",

									" information and all of your information is securely stored in our system.",
							showAnswer:true
					},
					{
							question:"Why do you need me to authorize a consent form?",
							answer:"This form will be sent to your creditors, to provide proof that you have authorized us to " +
									"speak on your behalf. Use of this form allows us to more quickly resolve medical debt, and do" +
									" this without trying to coordinate 3-way calls with you and the creditor, or getting your" +
									" authorization account by account. The consent form only authorizes us to work to resolve" +

					{
							question:"Is it a guarantee you will relieve my debt if I apply?",
							answer:"No, we cannot offer any guarantees. Every individual has a unique situation. We first need " +
									"to ensure we have enough donations to support our applicants. And then we need to negotiate" +
									" with your creditors which may take time. It is possible that one or more of your creditors " +
									"will be unwilling to negotiate the balance and we may not be able to relieve that debt, but we" +
									" strive to relieve 100% of applicantâ€™s debt.",
							showAnswer:true
					},
					{
							question:"How long does the process take?",
							answer:"This is entirely dependent on the donations available, the number of applicants, the number" +
									" of medical debts each applicant has, and the response time of the creditors. Generally, we " +
									"anticipate a range of 1 to 4 months after you have applied before we have full resolution.",
							showAnswer:true
					},
					
					{
							question:"My application was denied, what now?",
							answer:"This means that the information we received the credit bureau does not match the" +
									" information you provided. In this unlikely event, we will need you to submit proof of your " +
									"income to validate the eligibility of the program. Please follow the instructions in the email " +
									"you received.\n" +
									"We also encourage you to reach out to the medical provider directly to apply for financial" +
									" assistance or try to negotiate a discount. We are unable to assist with debts for those who" +

					{
							question:"How can I check the status of my application?",

					},
					{
							question:"I put my medical debt on a Visa or Mastercard, can I still apply?",
							answer:"No, unfortunately not. This debt is no longer officially confirmable as medical debt. " +
									"Relieving this type of debt would have tax consequences to you, the applicant. For every $1 we" +
									" relieve, you would owe tax as taxable income. We have a future program that we will be" +
									" working to get IRS approval on, which would allow us to consider debt such as this, but today," +
									" we cannot.",
							showAnswer:true
					},
					{
							question:"Will you sell or share my information?",
							answer:"Absolutely not! We use your information internally to absolve your medical debt. We will " +
									"never sell or share your information with any party that is unrelated to absolving your medical" +
									" debt. We share your information only to the extent necessary to resolve your debt, which is" +
									" to the credit bureau and your creditors.",
							showAnswer:true
					},
					{
							question:"How do you use the optional information I provided in the application?",
							answer:"Two part use. First we use this to help match you to donors who are interested in donating" +

									"Next, we aggregate all the responses received to get a picture of our applicant pool. We never" +
									" use the individual response, and the information is used to demonstrate the need across " +
									"different groups. Information used for this purpose would look something like this:\nX% of applicants are veterans.\n" +
									"X% of our applicants are single parents.\n" +
									"X% of our applicants are American Indian or Alaska Native.",
