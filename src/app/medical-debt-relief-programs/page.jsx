However, the benefit to this program is that we are targeting a complete abolishment of medical debt person-by-person. This program has the most meaningful immediate impact on each individual.  Donor dollars have an anticipated median impact of 50 to 1, meaning your $10 donation can abolish up to  $500 in debt."

The only drawback is that a significant number of families have more than one unpaid medical debt, and it could leave them with other medical debt obligations.  This program provides great value, but it is not achieving a complete clean slate that we are striving for."
